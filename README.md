# multispeciesPP

This is a fork of William Fithian's R package
[multispeciesPP](https://github.com/wfithian/multispeciesPP) for
fitting species distribution models to combined presence only and
presence absence data.

## Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the devtools package. 

```R
devtools::install_github("sampeel/multispeciesPP")
```

If you don't have `devtools` installed already, install it first. 

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

The package does not otherwise need devtools for normal use.


## Note

This is a purely experimental fork of Fithian's code.  We recommend
the original code be used for any serious analysis.
